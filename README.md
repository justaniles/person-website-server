#Server files for my portfolio
##Starting the server
1. Ensure the server isn't already running by running

```forever list```

2. Simply run the startServer.sh bash script

```./startServer.sh```

##Notes
If this server is pulled from the repository, *npm install must be run to install node dependencies.* The node_modules files are NOT version-controlled.
